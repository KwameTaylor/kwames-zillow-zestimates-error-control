# Kwame's Zillow Zestimates Error Control

Welcome to my data science clustering project: **Kwame's Zillow Zestimates Error Control**! This project will use clustering to find the drivers of error in the zestimate of single-unit properties that were isted on Zillow in 2017. I will demonstrate how this data can be used for quality control and preventing more Zestimate errors in the future.

I plan to create an MVP and then iterate through the data science pipeline multiple times.

Project Plan:
|    Date    |                                Goal                               |
|:----------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| 10/15/2020 | Project planning, start on outline/bones of project.              |
| 10/16/2020 | Finish MVP of wrangle.py and preprocessing.py.                    |
| 10/17/2020 | Finish MVP of explore.py and model.py.                            |
| 10/18/2020 | Finish MVP of entire project, start on second MVP iteration.      |
| 10/19/2020 | Iterate through the data science pipeline up to five times total. |
| 10/20/2020 | Practice project presentation, sleep.                             |
| 10/21/2020 | Presentation day!                                                 |

The project deliverables are the following: Jupyter Notebook walthrough with conclusion, data visualizations, README, and modules with functions (wrangle.py, preprocessing.py, explore.py, and model.py).
