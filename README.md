# Kwame's Zillow Zestimates Error Control

Welcome to my data science clustering project: **Kwame's Zillow Zestimates Error Control**! This project will use clustering to find the drivers of error in the Zestimate of single-unit properties that were listed on Zillow in 2017. I will demonstrate how this data can be used for quality control and preventing more Zestimate errors in the future.

I plan to create an MVP and then iterate through the data science pipeline multiple times.

**Project Plan:**

The project deliverables are the following: Jupyter Notebook data science pipeline walthrough with conclusion, data visualizations, README, and modules with functions (wrangle.py, preprocessing.py, explore.py, and model.py).
